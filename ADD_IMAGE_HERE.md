# Add Product Image

## Instructions

Please save the ROWER multi-row seeder PNG image to:

```
e:\rower\ROWER-\src\assets\products\rower-seeder.png
```

### Steps:
1. Right-click the PNG image I provided in the chat
2. Save it to your computer
3. Move/copy it to: `e:\rower\ROWER-\src\assets\products\rower-seeder.png`

The image should have a transparent background showing only the machine.

Once saved, the 3D viewer will automatically use this real product image instead of the placeholder SVG.

## What's Already Configured:
✅ Interactive3DViewer component created
✅ ProductsPage updated to import and use the real image
✅ Transparent background support enabled
✅ 3D rotation, zoom, and drag controls ready
✅ Cinematic animation sequence configured

## After Adding Image:
The development server will hot-reload and you'll see the real ROWER machine in the interactive 3D viewer!
